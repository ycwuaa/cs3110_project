Design Review
-------------

point of meeting: achievable but not trivial?

- "fun"/ moddability
- game state
  - HashTable, Map modules (instead of association lists) for territories?
  - input / output methods? how to recognize clickable areas
- modular - how easy to mod?
  - phases
- testing
  - unit tests (both by writers and others)
  - playtesting
- meeting times, schedule
  - implementation - try being done by the end of Thanksgiving Break
  - DUE: Dec 3
- output
  - display?
  - number of armies
- AI
  - similar to chess AIs
  - heuristic: metric for "goodness" of current situation
  - improve heuristic (highest expected gain)
  - computing against each other (genetic algorithms) - if wanted/have time (but advanced)
- init, endturn
  - distributing troops, territories
  - check win
  - movement of troops
- beginturn, attack
  - dice rolls
  - update game state with armies

- cheating? (allow with penalty?)
